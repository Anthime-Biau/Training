# My ML Training Repository

Hi, my name is Anthime Biau-Peyret, I'm 22 years old and I am studying at the Master of Informatics and Technology of Information in HEI. I'm training on my own to increase my skills in Machine Learning and i've decided to share my works in this repository.


## Description

In those different projects, I have tried to improve my skills with the Python scikit learn library using (Regression, Classification, Clustering, Dimentionnaly Reduction, Model selection, Preprocessing problems on Kaggle Competition.
